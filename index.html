          <p class="paragraph">
            Hello, my name is Justin Townsend. I'm a website developer, with three years of experience. <br>
            I began building websites in 2018, I was trying to figure out what I wanted to do with my life,
            when I accidently stumpled across coding, and I instantly fell in love with it!
            10 months later I landed my first job as a freelancer, building a website for a church called,
            "Straightway Church of Ooltewah".</p>

            <h3>Straightway Church of Ooltewah</h3>
            <p class="paragraph">The first freelancing job was building a website for a church called, "Straightway
              Church of Ooltewah".<br>
              The website was built using, HTML5, CSS3, and Bootstrap. This was the first website using Bootstrap,
              the plan was to build the website without using Bootstrap, however due to unforseen complications,
              with the design, and layout, Bootstrap was the obvious choice.

            <p class="white">The second freelance job was a website for a company called, "Ed Burke Auto,
              LLC".<br>
              The website was built using, PHP, CSS3, Bootstrap, and a HTML5 template for design.<br>
              PHP was used for the email feature in the footer of the website.
              It allows you to send an email directly to the company without having to leave the page.

            <p class="paragraph">The 3rd, and last freelancing job was to build a website using WordPress to a
              self-employed contractor
              by the company name of, "Yankee Contractor".<br>
              The website was built using WordPress because of its time complexity. The website was much faster to
              build, also having a better design
              to the UI, then using HTML5 and CSS3.</p>
